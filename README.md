# AgriAID

This project, developed for the AgriAID platform, implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify diseases in plants through images of their leaves. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and leverages Keras datasets for training and validation.

Features
Identifies various plant diseases from leaf images.
Utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
Built with TensorFlow and Keras.
Trained on a dataset of plant leaf images.
